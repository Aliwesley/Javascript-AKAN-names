            <p>The Akan (/ˈækæn/) are a meta-ethnicity living in the countries of present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast. 
              The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante) are a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of 
              the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family.Subgroups of the Akan people include: the Agona, 
              Akuapem, Akwamu, Akyem, Ashanti, Bono, Fante, Kwahu, Wassa, and Sefwi. Subgroups of the Bia-speaking 
              Akan groups include the Anyin, Baoulé, Chakosi (Anufo), Sefwi (Sehwi), Nzema, Ahanta, and Jwira-Pepesa. 
              The Akan subgroups all have cultural attributes in common; most notably the tracing of matrilineal descent, 
              inheritance of property, and succession to high political office.

            <p>In history, the Akans who live in Ghana migrated in successive waves between the 11th and 18th centuries. 
              Others inhabit the eastern part of Ivory Coast and parts of Togo.They migrated from the north to occupy 
              the forest and coastal areas in the south in the 13th century. The Akans have a strong oral history tradition 
              of their past and their also known in the art history world for symbolic artifacts of wood, metal and terracotta.
              Their cultural ideas are expressed in stories and proverbs and also in designs such as symbols used in carvings 
              and on clothes.The cultural and historic nature of the Akans in Ghana makes it an area of research for various 
              disciplines such as folklore, literary studies, linguistics, anthropology and history.

            <p>Akan culture can also be found in the New World.A number of Akans were taken as
                 captives to the Americas. Roughly ten-percent of all slave ships embarked from the
                 Gold Coast. The primary source of wealth within Akan economy was gold. However as
                 wars culminate in the region the capture and sale of Akan people peaked during
                 the Fante and Ashanti conflicts (as both sides sold a large number of their captives)
                 as prisoners of war.

                  <h1>AKAN <span>NAMES</span>.</h1>
                  <p class="r">Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first
                      name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
                      These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle
                      names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
                      ancestor's middle name.
